# Algorithm Visualizer

A web application that visually demonstrates how algorithms work. It can be used as a learning tool to explore and understand the behavior of various algorithms.

## Main Features

-   **Algorithm Visualization:**
    -   **Sorting:** Visually shows the step-by-step process of major sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort.
    -   **Graph Traversal:** (Planned for implementation) Will visually implement the behavior of graph traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). This is currently under development.
-   **Multiple Visualization Views:** Supports various views like arrays and bar graphs to intuitively check the execution process of algorithms.
-   **Intuitive User Interface (UI):** Designed with a visualizer panel, a detailed description panel, and a log panel to easily track and understand each step of an algorithm.

## Tech Stack

This project is developed using the following technologies:

-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
-   **State Management:** Zustand
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **Build Tool:** Vite

## Getting Started

How to set up and run the project in your local environment.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Clone the project repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-visualizer.git
    cd algorithm-visualizer
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all the necessary dependency packages for the project.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Start the development server and view the application in your browser.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    After running this command, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port displayed in your console) to see the application.

## Current Development Status and Future Plans

This project is under active development. Currently, it visualizes several sorting algorithms, and we plan to add the following features in the future:

-   More sorting and traversal algorithms (e.g., Heap Sort, Merge Sort, Dijkstra's)
-   Actual implementation and visualization of graph traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS
-   User-defined data input and visualization options
-   Performance optimization and UI/UX improvements

Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated.
